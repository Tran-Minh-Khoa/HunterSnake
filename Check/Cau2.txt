                                      Solve the equation:

                               X^4 - 24X^3 + 206X^2 - 744X + 945 = 0

         Let's call x, y, z, t as the roots of the equation above with ascending order. 

                           Eating the food with this order: x->y->z->t

     Assume the answer is : x=1, y=3, z=5, t=8. Eating the food with this order: 1->3->5->8
